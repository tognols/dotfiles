# dotfiles

Basically Vim config for now.
For C++ you need to install coc.nvim correctly with a language server like ccls or clangd.
Written for Linux, this config is suitable for Windows and MacOs too.

## For Groff
To install groff macros: (they work in combo w/ vim).

`mkdir ~/documents`

`mv groff ~/documents/groff`

## Scripts folder
Install those scripts in your path.
Eventually there will be a install.sh which install those scripts .local/bin and adds this to the PATH
