# dotfiles

*It's been a year since I've posted anything, so, most things combined together will not work. Now I'm using Budgie Desktop and multiple configurations, for laptop bspwm and for desktop i3-gaps, I'll update this repo I swear :')*

N.B. I just updated my vim configuration but not "standarized" it (A.K.A i need to test in Linux but should work fine) so i put it on the vim/ directory of this repo

Also, it's been a while since i didn't touch this configuration and a lot of things just changed, actually my mainly driver,
as now, is herbstluftwm in Linux and simply MacOs for daily usage at school (i know this kinda sucks but maybe i'll re-switch
to linux or BSD in the future).
I need to completely change this repo and make a theme folders. Also i need to make a install script (maybe working this time)
for herbstluftwm which does all the stuffs by himself, something like "just download the repo and run the install script"
These are my plans for the future, don't take the current rice seriously, it was like my first rice and that's all
