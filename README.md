# Dotfiles

Collection of configurations I use.

I've moved unused ones under "unused" (_duh_) since I'm no longer mantaining them.

windows folder contains Powershell profile to have that LukeSmith PS1 experience, everywhere.

As of today this rice is centered around NVIM (custom nvchad) and Hyprland on Arch and Artix.

### To install:
```
  git clone https://github.com/tognols/dotfiles
  cd dotfiles
  make all
```
This Makefile will:

1. automatically clone submodules 

2. move files around 

3. download NF symbols and place them under .fonts
